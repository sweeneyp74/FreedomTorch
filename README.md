# Project Freedom Torch
It's cool to be open minded.



### What is this?
[Freedom Torch](http://freedomtorch.co) is a web application created during a hackathon in November 2016, whose goal is to reduce the filter bubble. Social media has made it too easy for us to filter out beliefs that we don't agree with. In turn, this drives empathy way down and we have difficulty understanding how anyone could believe something opposite to our belief.

### How can I get involved?
We are looking for people who share a similar belief and want to help spread this message. Send an email to khabich@gmail.com and share your thoughts.
